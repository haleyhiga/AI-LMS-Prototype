## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors
The LMS uses a purple/indigo theme. To change colors, modify the Tailwind classes in `App.js`:
- Primary: `purple-600`, `indigo-600`
- Secondary: `purple-500`, `indigo-500`
- Accent: `cyan-400`

### Adding Features
The component structure is modular. Each view (Dashboard, Courses, Students, etc.) is a separate function component that can be easily extended.

### AI Configuration
AI features are currently simulated with mock data. To integrate real AI:
1. Replace mock data with API calls to your AI service
2. Update the recommendation engine logic
3. Connect to your grading system API

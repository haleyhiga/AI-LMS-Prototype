# OpenAI Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up OpenAI integration for AI-powered quiz generation in your LMS app.

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI Account**: You need an OpenAI account with API access
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the generated API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Add API Key to Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key:

```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 3. Restart the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

## Features

With OpenAI integration enabled, you'll get:

### ðŸ¤– Real AI-Generated Quizzes
- **Intelligent Questions**: OpenAI creates contextually relevant questions
- **Accurate Answers**: AI provides correct answers with explanations
- **Grade-Appropriate Content**: Questions tailored to specified grade levels
- **Multiple Question Types**: Multiple choice, true/false, short answer, fill-in-blank

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Topic Suggestions
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Get topic ideas generated by AI
- **Subject-Specific**: Suggestions tailored to Math, Science, English, History
- **Educational Focus**: Topics designed for effective learning

### ðŸ”„ Fallback System
- **Graceful Degradation**: If OpenAI is unavailable, falls back to simulated content
- **No Interruption**: App continues to work even without API key
- **Console Warnings**: Clear messages about API status

## API Usage

The integration uses:
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (cost-effective and fast)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and accuracy)
- **Max Tokens**: 2000 (sufficient for quiz generation)

## Cost Considerations

- **Quiz Generation**: ~$0.01-0.03 per quiz (depending on complexity)
- **Topic Suggestions**: ~$0.001 per request
- **Free Tier**: OpenAI provides $5 free credit for new accounts

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Not Working
1. Verify the key is correct in `.env.local`
2. Check if the key has sufficient credits
3. Restart the development server

### Fallback Mode
If you see "OpenAI API key not configured" in the console:
1. The app will use simulated content
2. All features still work
3. Add your API key to enable real AI generation

### Rate Limits
If you hit rate limits:
1. Wait a few minutes before generating more quizzes
2. Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan
3. The app will show appropriate error messages

## Security Notes

- **Client-Side Usage**: API key is exposed in the browser
- **Production**: For production, implement a backend proxy
- **Key Management**: Never commit API keys to version control

## Example Usage

1. **Generate a Quiz**:
   - Go to Assignments & Assessments
   - Click "AI Generate Quiz"
   - Select subject (e.g., "Math")
   - Enter topic (e.g., "Quadratic Equations")
   - Choose grade level and difficulty
   - Click "Generate Quiz"

2. **View AI Suggestions**:
   - Select a subject in the quiz generator
   - AI will suggest relevant topics
   - Click any suggestion to auto-fill the topic field

3. **Review Generated Content**:
   - Click "View Quiz" on generated assignments
   - Toggle "Show Answers" to see AI-generated answers
   - Review explanations and verify accuracy

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is valid
3. Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits
4. Try the fallback mode to test app functionality

**Note**: This integration is designed for educational purposes. For production use, consider implementing server-side API calls for better security.
